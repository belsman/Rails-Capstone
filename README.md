# Buzzer
## Buzzer is the next big thing. It's like twitter. You buzz, not tweet. :smiley:

> This project entails building a functional Rails application that resembles twitter. It's basically a twitter redesign. ```user```s sign-up, then they can create ```buzz```s that can be seen by other ```user```s following them. You can connect with other users by ```following``` them.
